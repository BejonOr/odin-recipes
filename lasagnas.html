<ol>
    <l1>Cook sausage, ground beef, garlic and onion in dutch oven until
        well browned
    </l1>
    <l1> Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. 
        Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally.</l1>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes.
         Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
    <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, 
        and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
    <li>To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. 
        Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
    <li> Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. 
        Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
    <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
